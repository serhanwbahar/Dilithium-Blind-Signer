# Experimental Dilithium Blind Signature Library for Digital Payments

This experimental library provides a secure implementation of blind signatures using the Dilithium post-quantum digital signature scheme. It is designed for use in digital payment systems, where payer privacy is essential.

## Overview

Blind signatures are a cryptographic primitive that allows a message to be signed without revealing its content to the signer. This is particularly useful in digital payment systems, where the payer's privacy is important. The Dilithium post-quantum digital signature scheme is a lattice-based scheme that provides strong security guarantees against both classical and quantum adversaries.

This library implements a `DilithiumBlindSignature` class for blind signature operations and a `DigitalPayment` class for creating, signing, and verifying payment requests.

## Choice of Blind Signatures

[Blind signatures](https://sceweb.sce.uhcl.edu/yang/teaching/csci5234WebSecurityFall2011/Chaum-blind-signatures.PDF) are essential in privacy-preserving digital payment systems because they allow a payer to obtain a signature on a payment request without revealing the details of the transaction to the issuer. This ensures that the payer's identity and transaction history remain private, even when the issuer is not trusted.

## Choice of Dilithium

[Dilithium](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/633.pdf) is a post-quantum digital signature scheme based on lattice cryptography. It provides strong security guarantees against both classical and quantum adversaries, making it a suitable choice for use in digital payment systems that require long-term security. Additionally, Dilithium has been submitted to the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization process, which attests to its security and performance.

## Example Usage

### Key Generation

Generate a Dilithium key pair for a payer:
```
from blind_signature_digital_payment import DilithiumBlindSignature

payer_secret_key, payer_public_key = DilithiumBlindSignature.generate_keypair()
```

### Payment Request Creation

Create a payment request:
```
from blind_signature_digital_payment import DigitalPayment

payment = DigitalPayment()
payment_id = "123abc"
amount = 42.0

payment_request = payment.create_payment_request(payer_public_key, amount, payment_id)
```

### Payment Request Signing (Blinding)

Generate a blinding factor and blind the payment request:
```
blinding_factor, blinding_factor_inv = DilithiumBlindSignature.generate_blinding_factor()
payment_request_json = json.dumps(payment_request, sort_keys=True)
blinded_payment_request = DilithiumBlindSignature.blind(payment_request_json, blinding_factor)
```

### Payment Request Signing (Issuer)

Sign the blinded payment request:
```
issuer_secret_key = b"issuer_secret_key_placeholder"
signed_blinded_payment_request = DilithiumBlindSignature.sign(issuer_secret_key, blinded_payment_request)
```

### Payment Request Signing (Unblinding)

Unblind the signed blinded payment request:
```
signed_payment_request = DilithiumBlindSignature.unblind(signed_blinded_payment_request, blinding_factor_inv)
```

### Payment Request Verification

Verify the signed payment request:
```
issuer_public_key = b"issuer_public_key_placeholder"
is_valid = payment.verify_payment_request(payment_request, signed_payment_request.hex(), issuer_public_key)

if is_valid:
    print("Payment request is valid")
else:
    print("Payment request is not valid")
```

## Future Work and Needs

While the current implementation provides foundation for privacy-preserving digital payment systems, there are several areas for future work and improvements:

1. Support for Additional Signature Schemes: Extend the library to support additional post-quantum signature schemes, such as Falcon or Rainbow. This would allow users to choose the signature scheme that best fits their needs in terms of security, performance, and compatibility.
2. Performance Optimizations: Investigate and implement performance optimizations to improve the efficiency of the library, particularly in resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices or IoT.
Higher-Level APIs: Develop higher-level APIs to simplify the integration of the library into existing payment systems, making it easier for developers to adopt the library.
3. Interoperability: Establish interoperability with other privacy-preserving payment systems and protocols, such as zero-knowledge proofs or confidential transactions. This would allow for increased collaboration and knowledge sharing across different projects and ecosystems.
4. Formal Security Analysis: Conduct a formal security analysis of the library to ensure its correctness and resistance to various attacks. This may involve engaging external security experts and conducting thorough code reviews and audits.
5. Comprehensive Test Suite: Develop a comprehensive test suite to verify the correctness and security of the library. This may include unit tests, integration tests, and stress tests to identify potential issues and vulnerabilities.
6. User-Friendly Documentation: Create user-friendly documentation, including tutorials, guides, and API references, to help developers understand and use the library effectively.
7. Community Engagement: Engage with the community to gather feedback, address concerns, and collaborate on the development of the library. This may involve hosting workshops, webinars, and hackathons to encourage participation and adoption.
